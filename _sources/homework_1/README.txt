Homework 1
============================
Homework 1 for Genome Sciences 541, assigned by `Jesse Bloom`_.

The homework is in a iPython notebook at 
https://github.com/jbloom/GenomeSciences541/tree/gh-pages/source/homework_1

Download the notebook, ``homework_1.ipynb``. Be sure to download the actual notebook, not the HTML rendering. You can do this in a variety of ways, including clicking on the notebook and then downloading the ``Raw`` rendering. Once you download the notebook, you can open it with::

    jupyter notebook homework_1.ipynb

This will require you to have ``jupyter`` and ``Python`` installed.

Note that the ``pyvolve`` package used by this homework is **only compatible with Python 2. It does not work with Python 3.**

You can also look at it directly by clicking on the notebook, but the math will not be rendered properly by GitHub.
